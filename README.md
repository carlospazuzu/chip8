# PzuCHIP-8

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zr6CcFM.gif)

It's a CHIP-8 interpreter wrote in C++ using [SFML]([http://sfml-dev.org](http://sfml-dev.org/)) for graphics and sound management.

By following the awesome repo named [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) that encourages people to implement from scratch things they would like to understand how it works under the hood, I've took the writing from scratch an emulator task as a personal challenge. My first goal was to build a NES emulator, but at all the places where I've found info about how to write emulators, stated the same thing: 
> "Go build a CHIP-8 emulator before going down on more complex stuff as NES emulators"

And so I did.

This software is highly influenced by [*massung*](https://massung.github.io/CHIP-8/) awesome CHIP-8 interpreter and written following the spetacular [*Cowgod's  Chip-8 Technical Reference*](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) .
